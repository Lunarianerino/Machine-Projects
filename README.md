##CCPROG 1 Machine Project - Little Red Riding Hood
We made a 2D Maze using C and we have to place the character (Little Red Riding Hood), nececssary materials scattered, the goal, the pits and the wolf around the maze and the character has to traverse the maze to get the necessary materials before getting to Granny while avoiding the traps all around. Refer to the discussion pdf for more information.
